# Movie-Trailer-Project
This project contains a list of my 6 favoite movies and their trailers on a site.  I wrote my code in Python, and used the file "fresh_tomatoes.py" to make my code into a usable site.

1. Download zip file in bottom right-hand corner
2. Open Documents/Udacity/Movie folder

4. Choose Run > Run Module from browser menu bar (or just press F5 on your keyboard)
# Source Files
You can view my source code in the following files:

media.py (Python file that instantiates movie class)
# Other Source Files
The remaining files were created by Udacity to help make the project run.
